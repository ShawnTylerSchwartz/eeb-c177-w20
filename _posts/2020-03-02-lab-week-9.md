## Regex Quiz in Python (Beggining of Lab - Week 9)
 - You will have a short quiz covering the regular expressions material that we went over in the first few weeks of class. The quiz will take place on your computers within a Python Jupyter Notebook at the beginning of lab (week 9, March 2nd, 2020). Therefore, you must understand both (a) how to use and write regular expressions, and (b) how to write them in Python using the `re` module.
 - You may be asked to create regex patterns for cases you saw within the readings of the textbook, labs and assignments from the beginning of the course, and what we have done in lecture this past week (week 8) on Tuesday and Thursday.

## Lab Homework (Due Thursday, 2/5 by 9:30am)
It is recommended that you get started on these assingments and work through them as soon as possible, as knowing and understanding the essentials of `R` earlier will allow you to better understand any `R` code gone over in lecture as well as to make more progress on your final project sooner.
