### Lecture Homework #1 (Week 2, Due Thursday, 1/16 before lecture by 9:30am)
Work through this Software Carpentry Tutorial [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html). You will need to download the `data-shell.zip` file and extract the contents to the folder that you will be doing this assignment in, which should be in `~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/` from the top of this page [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html). (Once you download it, you can drag it into the folder in your GitHub repo for this assignment, or you can use the commands we learned in class to do it via the shell, i.e., `mv ~/Downloads/data-shell.zip ~/Developers/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/` or however you have your file structure laid out. Turn in a file containing the commands you used to complete these tasks, along with another file of any explanations of what you did (if necessary). **Make sure to push this to GitHub before class on Thursday (1/16).
