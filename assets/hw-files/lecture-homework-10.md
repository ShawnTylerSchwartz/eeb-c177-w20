# Final Project Assignment (4.5% of final project grade)
## (Due Saturday, 2/29 at 11:59pm)

1. Create a LaTeX document that is an outline of your final report. This should include section headers (i.e., introduction, methods, results, discussion, absratct, references cited, figures, etc.) that describes your final project and the relevant research. This version is **an outline**, which is fine for now. Though, you should be and will be expected to be filling this in over the next few weeks to develop your **final project report**. 
2. Your methods section must include code that is integrated into the LaTeX document. This article[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_listing](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_listing) discusses how to use commands to load in formatted code into your LaTeX document. Please follow this guide to load in your initial code that you have been working on so far into your document. The code that you include must:
   - Include functions that open your final, manipulate your data in some way, and close the file
   - Must be commented and have function descriptions and comments that clearly outline what and why you are doing what you are with your code
   - Include use of the `re` module in some way with your data manipulations to do something interesting and useful with regular expressions within your Python script
3. Your introduction at the moment should contain **at least** an outline of the relevant literature and biologically motivating information for why you are working on this project in the first place.
4. Make a directory in your **final project repo** on GitHub called `report`, and include all necessary files for your LaTeX document in here. Name your LaTeX file something meaningful so that it is easy for me to find. Make sure that the output `PDF` file is also located within this `report` directory.
5. You will be graded on the contents of your LaTeX script, the output PDF, the content within the outline, and following the instructions presented in this homework description. Any outlines that do not follow the instructions of this document are subject to losing points.
