# Final Project Assignment (4.5% of final project grade)
## (Due Sunday, 3/8 by 11:59pm)

In preparation for your lightning talks and final project reports, the homework due by Sunday (3/8 at 11:59pm) is for you to add more information and content to your `LaTeX` outline that you started last week. Specifically:

   - add two figures made with `ggplot2` in `R` for us to see that you have experimented with it
   - make sure to show/provide your `R` code used to generate these plots by placing it within the `LaTeX` document like you did with your other code
   - comment all of your code and functions, and make sure your code is encapsulated within functions to show an organized thought process for the design of your program
   - Make sure that the most up-to-date rendered PDF file is within your `report` directory of your final project GitHub repository, along with the `LaTeX` script file
