See [https://shawntylerschwartz.github.io/eeb-c177-w20/2020/01/13/lab-week-2/](https://shawntylerschwartz.github.io/eeb-c177-w20/2020/01/13/lab-week-2/).
 - 2 Parts
  - Part 1: Due on GitHub Tuesday (1/14) by 9am
  - Part 2: Due on Github Thursday (1/16) by 9am

### Lab Homework (Week 1):
- You will keep a food log/journal for the next 5 days (starting this afternoon) using this file
- You must make **10 commits** separated by **at least 6 hours** (i.e., 2 commits per day) M-F this week
- Each time you update the food log, make a add, commit, and push changes to GitHub
- Each commit is worth 10% of your grade for lab homework this week
- I will be checking each of your GitHub repository's commit logs to grade you (remember, they are all timestamped), so I should see a total of 10 commits over the next 5 days (two per day) starting today
- Update the `food-log.txt` file using the vim commands we practiced
