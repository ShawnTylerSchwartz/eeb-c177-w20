## Lab Exercises & Homework
### Lab Homework (Week 2):
See [https://shawntylerschwartz.github.io/eeb-c177-w20/2020/01/13/lab-week-2/](https://shawntylerschwartz.github.io/eeb-c177-w20/2020/01/13/lab-week-2/).
 - 2 Parts
  - Part 1: Due on GitHub Tuesday (1/14) by 9am
  - Part 2: Due on GitHub Sunday (1/19) by 9am

### Lab Homework (Week 1):
- You will keep a food log/journal for the next 5 days (starting this afternoon) using this file
- You must make **10 commits** separated by **at least 6 hours** (i.e., 2 commits per day) M-F this week
- Each time you update the food log, make a add, commit, and push changes to GitHub
- Each commit is worth 10% of your grade for lab homework this week
- I will be checking each of your GitHub repository's commit logs to grade you (remember, they are all timestamped), so I should see a total of 10 commits over the next 5 days (two per day) starting today
- Update the `food-log.txt` file using the vim commands we practiced

## Lecture Exercises & Homework
### Lab Homework (Week 2, Due Thursday, 1/16 before lecture 9:30am)
Work through this Software Carpentry Tutorial [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html). You will need to download the `data-shell.zip` file and extract the contents to the folder that you will be doing this assignment in, which should be in `~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/` from the top of this page (http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html)[http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html]. (Once you download it, you can drag it into the folder in your GitHub repo for this assignment, or you can use the commands we learned in class to do it via the shell, i.e., `mv ~/Downloads/data-shell.zip ~/Developers/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/` or however you have your file structure laid out. Turn in a file containing the commands you used to complete these tasks, along with another file of any explanations of what you did (if necessary). **Make sure to push this to GitHub before class on Thursday (1/16).
